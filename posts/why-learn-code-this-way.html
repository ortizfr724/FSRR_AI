          <p class="text-justify">
            Welcome to FSRR-AI: Foundational Groundwork for Scaling to Full Stack Rails: AI: Learn the Prompt, Bridge the Gap. I'm embarking on a project to build a static blog, 
            and my approach is a bit different. Instead of what some might call "vibe coding" a term often associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">Andrej Karpathy</a>
            where you might just prompt an AI and copy-paste the results, my aim is a deeper dive.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            This blog will document my journey of understanding the fundamental building blocks of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, guided by the comprehensive curriculum of 
            The Odin Project. But there's a key element to my learning process: I'm using AI as my constant assistant and tutor. This intentional strategy is designed to show fellow 
            beginners how this method can be incredibly beneficial. By starting with a basic static website and actively writing the code, I'm not just learning syntax; I'm striving to 
            grasp the underlying meaning and purpose of each concept, often through guided exploration with AI.
          </p>

        <article class="p-sm">

          <h2 class="title-two">Here are some of the core benefits of this intentional learning approach:</h2>

          <ul>
            
            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Active Code Writing: Writing code by hand, rather than passively copying, reinforces understanding and solidifies concepts.</li>
            
            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Deeper Conceptual Understanding: Engaging with AI allows me to ask "why" and delve into the reasoning behind different coding methods.</li>
            
            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Personalized Guidance and Feedback: AI provides tailored explanations and feedback, helping me align with best practices from the start.</li>

            <li class="text-justify">
              Gradual Skill Development: Building from a static website allows for a step-by-step understanding of core technologies before moving to more 
              complex frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

            Ultimately, my goal with FSRR-AI is to provide a unique and motivating experience for beginners. I want to share the excitement of demystifying web development, 
            demonstrating that with a thoughtful approach and the support of AI as your education assistant, anyone can build a solid foundation and confidently begin their
            coding journey.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            This journey will evolve as the blog grows. You'll see improvements in HTML structure using utility classes, the application of positioning and spacing, and the 
            introduction of Object-Oriented CSS. We'll gradually progress through CSS properties, layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, all while keeping our sights set on 
            the end goal: understanding Full Stack development through the lens of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">The Odin Project</a>. This will allow you to 
            learn alongside the blog, witnessing the progression and understanding the “why” behind each step.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Over the past six months, as I've navigated The Odin Project, AI has been instrumental in clarifying complex topics and uncovering deeper insights into the technical 
            aspects of full-stack web development. Some of the areas I've explored with AI include:
          </p>

          <ul>

            <li class="text-justify mb-md">
              Understanding the best practices for using semantic HTML tags to give meaning and structure to web content. It's important to note that while HTML 
              focuses on semantic meaning, CSS is used to style these elements visually using selectors.
            </li>
            
            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Seeking recommendations for beginner-friendly HTML and CSS books that prioritize clear explanations and practical examples.</li>
            
            <li class="text-justify">Exploring core design principles and best practices for applying them to beginner projects, while also understanding common pitfalls to avoid.</li>
          
          </ul>
        
        </article>

        <article class="p-sm">

          <h2 class="title-two">To illustrate this, here are some of the initial setup components within The Odin Project that I explored with AI guidance:</h2>

          <ol>

            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Understanding work environment setup, including virtual machines and dual operating systems, and considerations for different operating systems.</li>

            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Learning the fundamentals of the command line.</li>

            <li class="text-justify mb-md">Setting up GitHub, including creating SSH keys and understanding repositories.</li>

            <li class="text-justify">Getting familiar with VSCode, the recommended code editor.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>
            This blog, FSRR-AI, is built on the belief that by understanding the fundamental groundwork with the assistance of AI - by learning the prompt and bridging the gap 
            between human understanding and artificial intelligence - beginners can confidently scale their skills towards the realm of Full Stack Rails development and thrive 
            in the evolving landscape of AI-augmented development teams. Join me on this journey as we unbox the world of code together!
