          <p>
            Welcome to FSRR-AI: Foundational Groundwork for Scaling to Full Stack Rails: AI: Learn the Prompt, Bridge the Gap. I'm embarking on a project to build a static blog, 
            and my approach is a bit different. Instead of what some might call "vibe coding" a term often associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">Andrej Karpathy</a>
            where you might just prompt an AI and copy-paste the results, my aim is a deeper dive.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog will document my journey of understanding the fundamental building blocks of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, guided by the comprehensive curriculum of 
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">The Odin Project</a>. But there's a key element to my learning process: I'm using AI as my constant assistant and tutor. This intentional 
            strategy is designed to show fellow beginners how this method can be incredibly beneficial. By starting with a basic static website and actively writing the code, I'm not just learning 
            syntax; I'm striving to grasp the underlying meaning and purpose of each concept, often through guided exploration with AI.

          <h2 class="title-two">Here are some of the core benefits of this intentional learning approach:</h2>

            <li class="mb-md">Active Code Writing: Writing code by hand, rather than passively copying, reinforces understanding and solidifies concepts.</li>
            
            <li class="mb-md">Deeper Conceptual Understanding: Engaging with AI allows me to ask "why" and delve into the reasoning behind different coding methods.</li>
            
            <li class="mb-md">Personalized Guidance and Feedback: AI provides tailored explanations and feedback, helping me align with best practices from the start.</li>
